𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭: Developing an application to help users plan an enjoyable evening by selecting a starting location in the city and suggesting nearby restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, and other points of interest. The app aims to provide users with a seamless experience in planning a night out with friends.

𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 / 𝐎𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐬: The "Planning Night Out" application provides a seamless user experience with two key roles: Organizer and Collaborator. Organizers can sign up for an account, start a plan, search for locations and events, add locations to their plans, invite others, and add collaborators. Once collaborators are added, notifications are sent to them. Organizers can also modify or delete plans as needed. Collaborators can sign up for an account, view events shared with them, RSVP to plans, see who else has RSVP’d, and suggest additional information to the organizer. Additionally, both organizers and collaborators can view detailed information about each location, including reviews, ratings, and pricing. This structure ensures a smooth workflow for organizing and collaborating on social events, making it easier to plan a fun and well-informed night out with friends.
